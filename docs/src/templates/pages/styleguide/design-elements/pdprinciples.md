## Essential Design Requirements for All Just Eat Digital

### Accessibility and Compliance for Digital

Any text or element that is directly important to the customer journey needs to be AA accessible. Any supporting or secondary elements related to a primary action or element does not have to be accessible. (e.g. A written link that also has an icon attached - the link should be accessible, the reinforcing icon does not have to be).

### Global Consideration and Localisation

Live text should be used where ever possible in digital for localisation consideration as we are attempting to have as much feature parity between apps and sites as possible.

### Consistency Wherever Possible & Practical

All elements, should be consistent across platforms as much as possible. Platform specific exceptions need to be approved by the larger UX team and documented within these style guides.

### Physical Usability is Essential

All elements must adhere to minimum font size and/or touch area size, as relevant - any text to be made smaller than the minimum must be approved as an exception by the UX/Brand lead.

### Accessibility checking

We recommend checking your accessibility through at least 2 of the 3 sites below to make sure whatever you are creating is AA compliant, especially for text. If you are checking accessibility for graphics or buttons that need to be compliant, best to ensure it's compliant for AA 12pt.

### Websites to check accessibility

- Contrast checker
- WEbAim
- Snook.ca
