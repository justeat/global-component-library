## Our Brand

Wow. What a journey. In 15 years we’ve grown from an ambitious crew of 15, to a passionate team of 1,800 dedicated to bringing 14 million-plus customers great food experiences. We’ve created a world of choice and built a robust tech platform: working with over 64,000 restaurant partners to serve everything from pizza to sushi, and burgers to burritos.

 That was just the beginning, and we’re super proud of it. But the best is yet to come. Nobody offers more variety when it comes to bringing people food. We welcome our customers in to our amazing and expanding world of choice with fresh ways to experience the food they love, and find food we know they will love.

 We inspire our restaurant partners to raise their game. Because we have data insights like no other, we highlight great opportunities to grow their businesses and raise standards across the industry. Relentlessly discovering and inventing new ideas and technologies that make things better for partners and customers.

 Our new purpose sits at the heart of everything we do, and that’s to make food discovery exciting for everyone. Food makes people happy, and we can’t wait to help them try trusted favourites and find new flavours.

 Let’s match a customer’s every mood with the perfect food – any occasion, any location, at any moment. We’ll get it to them from anywhere, fast, whenever and wherever they want it.

 We’re proud of what we’ve built, and the countless moments of joy we’ve brought people, everywhere. Now we can’t wait to make it even better.

**Welcome to the new Just Eat.**
