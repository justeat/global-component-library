<p>Page Banners stretch to the full width of their container, and contain banner images which typically use a <code>picture</code> element. They also display a white version of the Just Eat rays at the bottom.</p>

<p><em>The <code>pageBanner</code> component is an optional mixin within Fozzie â€” if you'd like to use it in your project you can include it by adding <code>@include pageBanner();</code> into your SCSS dependencies file.</em></p>
