<a name="js-structure"></a><h2 class="sg-sectionHeading">Structure</h2>

Some Fozzie modules will include JavaScript as part of it's structure (such as the [f-header module](https://github.com/justeat/f-header)), others will be specifically a JavaScript module like the [f-validate module](https://github.com/justeat/f-validate).

If the module includes SCSS as well, the JS should be located inside the `src/js` folder (from the route).

If the module is being written specifically to be a JavaScript module, then the entry file should be at `src/index.js`.


<a name="js-create"></a><h2 class="sg-sectionHeading">Creating a Fozzie JS module</h2>

The easiest way to create a Fozzie JS module is to use the [Fozzie Yeoman generator](https://github.com/justeat/generator-fozzie).

This will let you specify a number of options as to what aspects of your Fozzie module you would like to include â€“ such as whether you want CSS and JS folders as part of your module.
