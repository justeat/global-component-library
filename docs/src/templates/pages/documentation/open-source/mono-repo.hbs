## Introduction
As of October 2019, new Fozzie components will be created using the Vue.js framework. These new components will be stored in a _mono-repo_, a single repository where all components reside. Each individual component can be found in the [`packages`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages) directory, and are all controlled from a top level `packages.json`.

## Naming your packages in the mono-repo

 The general naming convention for a Fozzie package is to use `f-{your-package-name}` e.g. [`f-footer`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/f-footer), [`f-header`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/f-header), [`f-vue-icons`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/f-vue-icons).

## Publishing to npm

To publish a package to **npm**, please first ensure that you have registered an account. You may use an existing public account, but many Just Eat employees prefer to set up a new Just Eat-specific account.

Internal contributors (Just Eat employees) can request to be added to the Just Eat npm org by asking in the #guild-ui Slack channel and providing your npm account details. External contributors should raise a pull request and the release will be handled for you once approved

Once you are happy that the package is ready to be published to the npm registry, ensure you are on the correct branch — typically the master branch with the latest changes pulled — then run `npm publish` on the command line.
