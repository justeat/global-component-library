## `publish Failed PUT 402`

### *Problem*

```bash
npm ERR! publish Failed PUT 402
npm ERR! You must sign up for private packages : @justeat/{package-name}
```

### *Solution*

Execute the publish command with public access — `npm publish --access public`.


## `EPERM: operation not permitted`

### *Problem*

```bash
npm ERR! code EPERM
npm ERR! errno -4048
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted
```

### *Solution*

Execute the npm login command — `npm login` — on the command line then sign in using your npm credentials.


## SCSS imports cannot be found

### *Problem*

If you are having issues with SCSS eyeglass packages which cannot be located e.g.

```bash
Error: Could not import kickoff-utils from any of the following locations:
>> @import 'kickoff-utils'; // imports a set of helper functions and mixins – h
--------^
```

### *Solution*

Check the dependencies section of the package.json file and ensure that the package in question is present — if it's in the devDependencies section then it should be moved to the dependencies section.


## Package.json `"Files"` property

### *Problem*

None of the files are present when the package is deployed to npm

### *Solution*

The paths should be declared like so

Bad

```json
"files": [
  "./dist",
  "./src/img",
  "./src/scss"
]
```

Good

```json
"files": [
  "dist",
  "src/img",
  "src/scss"
]
```
