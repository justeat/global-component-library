We have tried to decouple our UI stack away from our back-end (.NET) stack, so that developing front-end code can be fast and iterative. This also enables our front-end developers to work in the environment that is most productive for them.

If you are going to be developing front-end code for the Just Eat platform, it’s recommended that you take the time to read through this documentation to get a better understanding of the tools we use and why we are using them.


## Web Stack

The Global Just Eat front-end stack uses:

- Gulp as our task runner
– Sass and PostCSS for CSS processing
– ES6 with Babel for JavaScript transpilation
– Jest for JS testing
– Yarn for handling package dependencies.


## Front-end Build Tasks

Gulp is a front-end task runner that automates tasks such as Sass compilation and Babel transpilation.

We use Gulp on the Just Eat web platform to tie together all of the front-end workflow tasks.  To find out more about Gulp and how we use it, take a look at the [Gulp section of this documentation]({{ ../baseUrl }}/documentation/general/gulp).
