We have tried to decouple our UI stack away from out back-end (.NET) stack, so that developing front-end code can be fast and iterative. This also enables our front-end developers to work in the environment that is most productive for them.

If you are going to be developing front-end code for the Just Eat platform, itâ€™s recommended that you take the time to read through this documentation to get a better understanding of the tools we use and why we are using them.


## Web Stack

Fozzie itself has been created to be fairly technology agnostic.  At it's core, it's simply a UI framework built on Sass and Vanilla JS.

Therefore teams at Just Eat are using Fozzie on projects built in React, Vue.js and Vanilla JS, using WebPack and Gulp as their task runner. It could potentially be used on any stack (including CMS platforms such as WordPress).

In terms of the current Just Eat web front-end stack, we use Gulp (as our task runner), Sass and PostCSS (for our CSS processing), ES6 with Babel (for our JavaScript) and Jest (for JS testing).

We also use Yarn for our package dependencies.


## Front-end Build Tasks

Gulp is a front-end task runner that automates tasks such as Sass compilcation and Babel transpilation.

We use Gulp on the Just Eat web platform to tie together all of the front-end workflow tasks.  To find out more about Gulp and how we use it, take a look at the [Gulp section of this documentation]({{ ../baseUrl }}/documentation/general/gulp).
